Kinesis data firehose is reading data from kinesis data streams and writing transformed data to s3 
When completed, It will create event in cloud watch 
When there is a event match, a lambda will trigger and invoke a glue job.


Resources:
-Kinesis data firehose
-Kinesis data streams
-S3 
-CloudWatch Event 
-Lambda
-Glue Job
